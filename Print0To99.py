Instructions:
Before running the program, predict what it will display
in the console. Then run the program to check your prediction.
Could this program be written with a while loop?
Modify the program so that it prints the numbers 1 to 100, inclusive.
Next, modify the program so that it prints the event numbers between
2 and 20, inclusive. What about the odd numbers between 2 and 20?
Finally, modify the program so that it prints the numbers
99 to 0 in order, where each number is on a seperate line.
